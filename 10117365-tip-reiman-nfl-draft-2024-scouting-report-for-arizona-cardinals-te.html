Partly a product of Illinois' offense, but makes the projection difficult nonetheless.</p><p><b>2023 STATISTICS</b></p><p>— 12 G, 19 REC, 203 YDS (10.7 AVG), 3 TD</p><p>— Born Sep. 17, 2001</p><p>— Unrated LB recruit in the 2020 class, per <a href=# rel=noopener>247Sports</a></p><p>— 28 career starts</p><p>— Attended 2024 Shrine Bowl</p><p>Tip Reiman is an unproven pass-catcher with rare size and athletic ability.</p><p>Reiman is a hulking presence at 6'5" and 271 pounds, but he carries that weight exceptionally well. He is a strong, powerful mover who can run clear of defenders in the short to intermediate area. Reiman regularly buys himself space on flat routes and underneath crossers.</p><p>Reiman is also a fairly coordinated mover. On some sharper routes, such as stick routes and in-breakers, he is not nearly as clunky as his size would suggest.</p><p>Reiman is a strong, experienced blocker as well. Illinois regularly deployed him as an in-line tight end at the point of attack. Reiman acquitted himself well in those moments, showing the movement skills, strength and technique to execute all kinds of blocks.</p><p>However, Reiman is unproven and somewhat limited as a receiver right now. For as well as Reiman moves at his size, he doesn't have legit field-stretching speed. Reiman also lacks some of the foot quickness and agility to suddenly uncover himself from defenders.</p><p>Reiman isn't the ball-winner his frame would suggest, either. He is a big, solid target over the middle when his feet are planted, but he does not yet show the quickness or in-air ability to go up and win the ball consistently.</p><p>At this stage, Reiman is just an idea, but an exciting idea at that. Tight ends with Reiman's size, athletic profile and blocking chops are tough to find. Reiman will just need time and a clear plan in order to develop into a worthwhile receiving product. Reiman fits best in a run-first offense that wants to put two tight ends on the field.</p><p><b>GRADE</b>: 6.2 (High-Level Developmental Prospect — 5th Round)</p><p><b>OVERALL RANK</b>: 152</p><p><b>POSITION RANK</b>: TE8</p><p><b>PRO COMPARISON</b>: Brock Wright</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWyAd4GMraCpZaKatq6tzWaln6Rdmb%2BistNmaWlqZGLApLvUraCnn12nsrG70a1kn6eiYq6ztdmopZplk5a%2FpbXNmqOsZaSa</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
