After a representative of Jax came out to say that the allegations made by Lance blindsided him, the former boybander is telling his side of the story.</p><p>Although Lance did the right thing by cutting ties with the reality star, he’s taking a lot of heat for being friends with him in the first place. Viewers will remember he stepped up to marry the couple after their pastor was exposed for being homophobic.</p><p>Fans wanted to know why he’d do such a thing with Jax’s history of being the villain and defending his pastor.</p><p>Bass opened up about all the drama on his podcast.</p><p>‘You wanna know what really went down? Look, I’m gonna preface this right now, because I know we have a lot of new listeners here. I do not think Jax Taylor is a racist or a homophobe, and I’ve said that millions of times. I would not be acquaintances with someone if I thought you were a racist and a homophobe. It just doesn’t make sense. The whole reason I married him and his wife last summer was I thought it was a great statement, because I was replacing their [homophobic] preacher. To me, that was a statement, and I thought it was big of them to make that statement.’</p><p>He went on to say that they went into business together because he wanted to show the world that Jax had changed; however, he saw that that wasn’t the situation when he watched the 40-year-old tweet up a storm during the episodes airing.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/CBCEbFZFqEd/</a></p><p>vand</p><p>He went on to explain: ‘I was happy to back him and believe in him, and I always want the best things for him — but then, this season started airing, and he reverted back to the same crap he was spewing. I obviously have not heard anything racist come out of his mouth. I mean, I hear of tweets. I’m still confused exactly, the exact tweets everyone’s pissed about. This is all I know: I never heard him say a racist thing, except the big nose thing recently.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Jax has yet to respond to Bass’ rebuttal.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeclruksYybmKyrXZi5or7In6Ceq12staLAjKGYqaiVo7KlecGeq7CdlaN6qbXMZpinnF2frrl505qwpaeiYrGmssSnm6xlmJ7AbrDEnKCsoZ%2BjerW7jKaYq6qpYsGixcuoqWaZnpl6o77IrauapqlisKK%2B07Cpop%2BYqXp1fJZsb21n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
