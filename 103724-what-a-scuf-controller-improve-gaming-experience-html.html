For many, the culprit/scapegoat is always the controller. Undoubtedly, a slow one can impact your maneuver in the playing field. Because of this, the SCUF controller has been introduced and is believed to improve one’s gaming experience. Is this the case, though? Join us as we explore the association between increased gaming experience and this controller.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/2de393a6a70a1304.jpg><p class=align-left>If you are looking to up your game, video game experts suggest you try the SCUF controller. Nonetheless, most gamers are still sceptical about how it helps in boosting one’s performance. Therefore, this article will evaluate what this tool does and if it is the way forward for a better gaming experience.</p><h2>What is a SCUF controller?</h2><p class=align-left>It refers to a third-party customized controller that is easy to modify and with tools that provide extra beneficial buttons in PS4 and <a href=#>Xbox One games</a>. Is there a SCUF controller for Xbox? Yes, but only that for Xbox One games.</p><h2>What is the difference between the SCUF controller and regular controllers?</h2><p class=align-left>At first glance, it is hard to distinguish between these two. However, the two are different. One of the visual differences between the two is where the logo lies. The regular <a href=#>PS and Xbox</a> logos are at the centre. However, the SCUF PS4 controller has a custom logo on several models.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/331ac37297b3a75a.jpg><p class=align-left>Similarly, another difference is that some of these PS4 controllers, like the SCUF Impact, has blank button symbols. You will also notice more changes in the rear, especially in the placement of the rear paddles. Since this tool is custom-designed, it has additional features that give you an added advantage over gamers using the regular ones.</p><p class=align-left>For example, you may customize your PS4 SCUF controller to have anti-friction rings, remapping, grip, and trigger system features. These fine tuned settings allow you to have a better and high gaming performance.</p><h2>What does a SCUF controller do?</h2><p class=align-left>The one thing that these controllers promise is comfort. In addition, they allow you to customize various things for better performance. For example, you could change the shape of the D-pad, analogue sticks, or the triggers at its back. You also have the option of changing the colour of the triggers, rings, and buttons of your joysticks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/c8064aca924b69f2.jpg><p class=align-left>When you change the analogue sticks, you boost your comfortability, especially if you have a long game session. In addition, the paddles mimic face button actions. These allow gamers to retain their thumbs on their thumbsticks, meaning more control, speed, and, most likely, wins.</p><h2>Which SCUF controller is best for PS4?</h2><p class=align-left>SCUF Vantage 2 PS4 controller reviews reveal that this is perhaps the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">best controller </a>to use when playing PlayStation 4.
