Fans were in a tizzy on Monday, July 20, after Good Morning America welcomed <strong>Jake Gyllenhaal</strong> to the show as his ex-girlfriend <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>'s hit song "Bad Blood" played in the background — but Gyllenhaal himself says he wasn't at all fazed by the coincidence. In fact, he told <strong>Howard Stern</strong> on Wednesday that he didn't even notice.</p><p>The shock jock brought up the incident during an interview with the Southpaw actor, 34, on his SiriusXM radio show, pointing out that it was a "big deal" on social media. "Were you aware of that?" he asked.&nbsp;</p><p>Gyllenhaal replied with a laugh and a simple "no," then went on to add, "First of all, I did not hear that. When I'm doing an interview, when you are up at 5 a.m. and you can't make sense of words, you're not thinking about the background music that's playing behind you."</p><p>Stern joked that the show's producers were "up to shenanigans" and played the song on purpose to "make some sort of association." But Gyllenhaal didn't take the bait.&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm sure they have so much music on that show playing all the time," he demurred. "It's just one of those things."</p><p>Stern continued to press the star about his relationship with the "Style" singer, 25, whom Gyllenhaal dated briefly in 2011, and who's now hot and heavy with Scottish DJ Calvin Harris. "I feel — and this is me stepping in — you should have married Taylor Swift, and I'll tell you why," he said. "What a power couple!"&nbsp;</p><p>He continued: "I would have said, 'Jake, this is The One.' Because to me, nothing is sexier than a woman who can play songs and write."&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Gyllenhaal, for his part, had nothing but nice things to say about the pop sensation, telling Stern she's a "beautiful girl."</p><p>He played dumb, though, when Stern's co-host Robin Quivers asked about the song Swift had written about him — "All Too Well," from her 2012 album Red.</p><p>"Do I [have a song]? I don't know," he quipped.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGao5VitLq4y56loZmRoXqxuMCyqmabn656oq7OrqtmnahitKq%2By5%2Bpop2emXq1rdilpqtlo6y2p8CMa2dqbWJohA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
