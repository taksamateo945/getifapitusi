I gave her the bones,” she continued. “But they wanted a whole different look than what was me.”</p><p>Hubert said many were surprised she initially <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">auditioned</a> for the mother role on the show. She said, “everybody kept saying, ‘Who are you auditioning for?’ I would say, ‘the mother,’ and they said, ‘Really?’</p><p>“I said, ‘Oh my God! I’m getting a migraine, ’cause I was like you ain’t getting this job.’ So I could care less. So I went in and I just nailed it.”</p><p>Hubert beleived she landed the part because, “they [production] said it was not what you did with the lines, it’s what you did in between the lines. Sometimes it’s all the nuances of characters.”</p><p>She adds, “So you can walk in and change their mind because they don’t know what they want until you walk in.”</p><p>Although she showcased her confidence as a Black woman, Hubert also shared that her skin complexion created a “barrier” for other roles she’d audition for.</p><p>“I grew up in the ’70s. I was in the business in the ’70s and college in the ’70s and the ’80s … I remember auditioning for certain jobs where they would say, ‘Well she’s really great, but she’s so dark.'” She added, “It never destroyed me because I felt that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">my black is my beauty.”</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>OMGOMGOMGOMG <a href=#>@OGJanetHubert</a> and Will talking for the first time in 27 years!!!!!!! <a href=#>#FreshPrinceReunion</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/4UYPFWDckp</a></p>— The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (@Fresh_Prince_TV) <a href=#>November 19, 2020</a></figure><p>Hubert’s role as Vivian “Aunt Viv” Banks was recast after season three of the “Fresh of Prince of Bel-Air” in 1993. Her departure from the show, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">including her replacement <strong>Daphne Maxwell Reid</strong></a>, led to a nearly three-decades-long feud with Smith.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hubert and Smith reconciled </a>in the 2020 “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” reunion special that debuted on HBO Max, where the actress reiterated that she blamed Smith for being blackballed from the industry. Eventually, she landed roles on “The Bernie Mac Show, “One Life to Live,” and <strong>Tyler Perry</strong>‘s “If Loving You Is Wrong,” amongst others.</p><p>Looking on her past roles, Hubert said, “There’s a show for everyone, there’s a place for everyone. You have to make them see you.”</p><p>“I remember auditioning for ‘The Wiz,’ and getting cut three times. … Then, lo and behold, the person who cut me turned out to be the very same choreographer that choreographed [a] dance number on ‘The Fresh Prince,'” she explained.</p><p>“He said to me, ‘the reason I cut you was because&nbsp;you were not ready, baby. Those girls were gonna eat you alive.’ So I was all of, like, 21, 22 at the time, and had no kind of experience. You can change their minds, and if you can’t change their minds, then be gone.”</p><p>Hubert recently starred in Lifetime’s “Single Black Female,” an adaptation of the 1992 cult classic “Single White Female.”</p><p>More Stories from Our Partners:</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Actress Janet Hubert Says She ‘Absolutely’ Contemplated Suicide Following Her Exit from ‘Fresh Prince of Bel-Air’</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“I Think He’s In A Pretty Good Place Mentally … I Think He’ll Be Ready To Play Mentally When He’s Physically Ready” | What We’re Still Getting Wrong About Ben Simmons</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jamaican Immigrant Becomes First Black Woman Chosen to Lead a Federal Reserve Bank</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9ze49rZmpuX6m1psWMsJinrJWZeqJ51qGmpZ1dmbanssSrnKesXaG8sLeMrZ%2Bapl2staLAjLCYrGWdmnqrrc2eq2agpZeys8CMq5yvnZGhwG60zrBkrKCVYrCwutWipZydlGKzs7HSoWSpqpmjsKZ5zp9km52cYq6qvoypqaicpZjBqrvNZquhmaRiwKmxjLCYrGWRqru1edWirWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
