But I just didn’t want to do anything about it, really. I felt like my wine and my pasta and biscuits and crackers and cheese were getting me through.”</p><p><strong>Gwyneth</strong> was able to lose weight with the help of <strong>Dr. Will Cole</strong>, who put her on a bone broth diet and plan that he created for her. She has since lost 11 pounds.</p><p>“I remember when I started this intuitive fasting program Jan. 3. I thought, all I could think about was, ‘When can I have a cocktail again?’” <strong>Gwyneth</strong> said (via <a href=#>Yahoo</a>). “You know me, I don’t cheat, I don’t break, I’m so disciplined and I was like, I can’t do this. Then I started to feel so good after about 60 days in.”</p><p>She continued, “And now I’m starting to feel so good that I’m like, yeah, like, I would drink if I could, maybe, but not seven days a week anymore. I don’t want to go back to that.”</p><p><strong>Gwyneth</strong> also <a href=#>recently opened up about her husband’s struggles with COVID-19</a> and the symptom that lasted for nine months.</p><p><span>Just Jared on Facebook</span></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Justjared.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6ton6euu6bAx2anmqSkp7y4edGerZ6ZnKh6qbvWZqSum5hixKa1xqGrZquYmnqorcinnJ1lmaN6ssHAq5inrJmjsm68y66qZqCfrHq0tMRmo6irpGK2tXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
