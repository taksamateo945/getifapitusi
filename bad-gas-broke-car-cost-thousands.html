As soon as I left the station and merged onto I-85, my car's engine light came on and then the engine shut off. There was a lot of traffic, but I was able to pull over. I tried to restart the car, but it wouldn’t start.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">We had the car towed to a repair shop in Greenville, S.C.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The repair shop said the car was filled with bad gas and they needed to clean the fuel tank and change the fuel filter and fuel pump. I took a sample of the gas back to the gas station. They said their gas is clean and they kept the sample. However, I also filed a report with the South Carolina Department of Agriculture, which investigated. Their lab report confirmed the presence of water and sediment, and the state ordered them to stop selling the gas until it was corrected.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">My insurance covered my repairs after my $500 deductible. But I also had to rent a car for one week and had other expenses, including a hotel stay. I have tried to contact the gas station again, with no luck.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">- Devraj Borah, Morrisville, N.C.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Got a consumer problem? The ABC News Fixer may be able to help. <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>Click here to submit your problem online</a>. Letters are edited for length and clarity.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv"><strong class=vtka>Dear Devraj:</strong> You did exactly the right thing in going to state regulators, because their report and stop-sale action helped elevate this from a typical “he said, she said” dispute. Armed with that info and the receipts from your repairs and other expenses, we were able to contact Westar Oil Company’s headquarters in Miami and ask them to take another look.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">They asked for some additional documentation, but soon agreed to refund you $2,079.67 for the repairs, rental car and hotel, without admitting any fault in the matter. You’ll have to give $895.58 back to your insurance company, but you can keep the rest.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Getting gas that’s contaminated with water isn’t a common occurrence, but it does happen. Last spring, the ABC News Fixer <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>helped a Michigan man</a> after his Corvette was damaged by watery gas.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">For anyone else in this situation, be sure to document everything. Keep your receipt for the gas, and know the pump number and exact time and date of the purchase. Immediately call the state’s weights and measures inspectors (often part of the state Department of Agriculture), and ask them to send an inspector right away.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Have a certified mechanic look at your car. If they find water in the gas, ask them to keep a sample. Document the chain of evidence in case you need to have the sample tested for a court battle. And call your insurance company.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">- The ABC News Fixer</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk eTIW sUzS"><strong class=vtka><a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>CLICK HERE to go to The ABC News Fixer homepage</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZkpi7psPSZ56oZpOkunCOy6irrZ2iZK%2BisIygmKxlkqe8rLGMnJirZZOkwLV506GmrquRo7G0e9Ktpquxb56xfn6TcHBsaGdu</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
