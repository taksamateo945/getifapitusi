Either way, she’s one real housewife with a real opinion and she’s not afraid to call out her New York City costars with her thoughts. For example, she thinks that everyone sucks up to<a href=#> Bethenny Frankel</a>, and she’s really good friends with Luann even though they have their issues. Frankly, as a group of adult women with careers and families and their own lives to worry about, it’s difficult for me to process how they can stand around and argue and fight and scream obscenities with people on national television; but to each his own.</p><p>We’re all entertained by it, so we’ll leave the drama of life to reality stars with a glass of wine, our pajamas and the smug knowledge that the biggest drama in our own lives is being judged for actually getting dressed and wearing lipstick to drop our kids off at school (every day, baby). With that said, we do love Sonja Morgan. Her twitter is one of our favorites, so here you go.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Who isn’t? Moderation.

We love that about her, to be quite honest. Here’s to making sure she’s all about getting what she wants out of life.</p><p>Dont u hate when u have to explain what “no” means, always with this group! <a href=#>#RHONY</a> on <a href=#>@bravotv</a> tonight at 9pm <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/HfmvWPKlIT</a> — Sonja Morgan (@SonjatMorgan) <a href=#>August 17, 2016</a></p><p><strong>No Means No&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Truer words, my friends. No means no, yet most people have no idea what the means. You have to explain it, even though it’s a full sentence that does not require further explanation.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Check <a href=#>@DrBraverman</a> off the list I go every 2months. To stay vibrant. But time for alittle Botox on my forehead???? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/cg5U3S3dtA</a></p><p>— Sonja Morgan (@SonjatMorgan) <a href=#>August 13, 2016</a></p><p><strong>She’s Honest&nbsp;</strong> What we love most about Sonja Morgan is that she’s not afraid to tell us how she manages to look so good. If you do it, own it. If you’re a woman over the age of 3 without any movement to her forehead, we all know you have botox. Let me just explain to you this; it’s not a secret.</p><p>Just listed all my hair products on <a href=#>https://t.co/wUS6kqpnXO</a> <a href=#>@LADYBUNNY77</a> <a href=#>#LadyBunny</a> hair morning after lol <a href=#>#rhony</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/pFwqe9Z53t</a> — Sonja Morgan (@SonjatMorgan) <a href=#>August 12, 2016</a></p><p><strong>She’s Not Perfect&nbsp;</strong></p><p>And she owns it. We love that. Of course, no one cares what her hair looks like with a body like that. She works hard, so why not show it off?</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Check out my <a href=#>@Snapchat</a> for my everyday life (for me) which u will see is very boring ???? but it’s all mine <a href=#>#snapchat</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ZYRwXqAnTv</a></p><p>— Sonja Morgan (@SonjatMorgan) <a href=#>August 11, 2016</a></p><p><strong>Boring is Fun&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The older I get, the more I realize just how much I actually enjoy the little things in life. Like not doing anything and not going anywhere and not worrying about things like that. Boring is good; boring is best.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGiqqKaalnquu9GgmKdlpKy2tcDEq2Spp6OpwHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
