That’s gorgeous. How old is he now?”</p><p>Ellen quipped: “Too young for you, he’s a child, look at him.”</p><p>Diane replied: “Maybe he’d like to know me. No, no, no… Shall I leave?”</p><p>Deacon isn’t the only young man to have caught Diane’s eye as she’s known to be a fan of Justin Bieber and had a great time recently filming the “gorgeous and genius” star’s ”Ghost’ music video.</p><p>She said: “So much fun, you guys. No, he’s a great man. Young man! Gorgeous and genius.</p><p>“It was one of the most pleasant experiences of my life.</p><p>“I loved it. He’s adorable, he’s the greatest guy. Special, sweet.”</p><p>While the ‘Book Club’ star insisted she isn’t dating at the moment, she suggested she’s previously dated a 20 year old.</p><p>She said: “The youngest age of a man I’ve gone out with? I don’t go out.</p><p>“Let’s pretend I have. Probably someone like 20. Not recently! I haven’t been out.”</p><p>The ‘Poms’ actress – who has two adopted children, Dexter, 27, and Duke, 22 – has previously dated the likes of Woody Allen, Warren Beatty and Al Pacino but never married and doesn’t regret the fact she didn’t.</p><p>She previously said: “I think I’m the only one in my generation and maybe before who has been a single woman all her life.</p><p>“[I’m not sad] because I think that I needed more of a maternal aspect. I don’t think it would have been a good idea for me to have married, and I’m really glad I didn’t, and I’m sure they’re happy about it, too.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOnaCappViuKat06ilZqyYnrusv4yrnJ6rlWLEqsDHnqmsqJ%2Bku7R5kHFksp2Rp3qwuMNmqqimXZ7AbrPOq56ep6WofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
