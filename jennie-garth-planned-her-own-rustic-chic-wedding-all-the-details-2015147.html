She and her team put everything together,” one source tells <strong>Us</strong>. “It was obviously a lot of work but…it was very romantic,” the insider recalls, adding that everything was outside and “they had tea lights and little balls of light hanging from the trees.”</p><p>The blushing bride’s groom also took elements of the wedding into his own hands too. According to the source, Abrams said vows to all three of Garth’s daughters before exchanging them with her. “It was so sweet, one by one,” the insider tells <strong>Us</strong>. “He made everyone cry. He had different vows for each of the girls. He said: ‘I’m so honored to take on the role of your stepfather. You guys are like my daughters.’ He said he loves and respects them. It was really sweet.” Garth shares <strong>Luca</strong>, 17,<strong> Lola</strong>, 12, and<strong> Fiona</strong>, 8, with ex-husband <strong>Peter Facinelli</strong>.</p><p>Guests, including pal and former costar <strong>Tori Spelling</strong>, then enjoyed Southern food, including grits and chicken, and danced the night away while sipping on moonshine cocktails after the intimate ceremony, which took place at Garth’s Los Olivos, Calif., ranch home.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The couple, who color-coordinated in shades of gray, shared their first dance to <strong>Elton John</strong>’s “Your Song,” and trees were adorned with signs which read “Dancing This Way” and “Bar This Way” to help guide guests as they partied.</p><p>Garth and Facinelli were married for 11 years before finalizing their divorce in June 2013.
