Kelly known during a brand new interview. As you can imagine, his words got social media very upset.</p><p>While chatting with Variety, Drake’s dad called R. Kelly a friend and also claimed Empire actor Jussie Smollett has been ‘misunderstood.’</p><p>As you may know, on February 22, Kelly was charged with ten counts of aggravated sexual abuse and pleaded ‘not guilty.’</p><p>Meanwhile, Jussie Smollett has been accused of staging a hate crime against him because he was not happy with his salary on Empire.</p><p>It may have been just a PR move for him but Smollett ended up being charged with one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.</p><p>When asked about R. Kelly, Drake’s father responded: ‘He’s a good friend of mine. I wish him the best. I hate that it’s happening to him. There’s a reason why women come out after the fact. He has my support 100%.’</p><p>While that statement is more than enough to get him in hot water, Dennis made it even worse when he added: ‘Jussie has been misunderstood. As a matter of fact, they know that. That story that came out about Jussie in Chicago is not true about Jussie. Jussie is a friend of mine, also. They have totally reconstructed his story.’ Yikes!</p><p>It did not take long for people to start dragging him on social media!</p><p>Some ‘cancelled’ him while others made it clear that ‘Drake’s dad needs new friends.’</p><p>Others were worried that the man’s shocking statements might affect Drake.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>‘Drake’s dad is a f***ing idiot apparently. Lol,’ a user said, not holding back at all.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeUp66ssdJmnZqsmJq%2FbrDEn5ynnKNis7O1xKebrGWaqsC0tcRmqqannKGytcCMmqWdZaJiuKa4y7JkrKeTnq6tecyem6KZXZ7AbrLUq6CoraNif3Z9kmpsaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
