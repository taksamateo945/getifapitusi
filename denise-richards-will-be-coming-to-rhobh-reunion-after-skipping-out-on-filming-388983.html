The network shared that in December — the actress stopped taping with the group.</p><p>If you aren’t caught up on the allegations, it is being said that Brandi Glanville and Denise had an affair after Richards told Brandi that she had an open marriage with her brand new husband.</p><p>In the preview, Denise is seen saying that she is ‘very married.’ She’s also seen storming off with her husband who she tells not to say anything because they’re on camera.</p><p>While the season was being filmed, the things that were leaked seem to be accurate according to the sneak peek of the season.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwt2dEZnZfs</a></p><p>Since the Bold and the Beautiful actress went missing multiple times during filming and allegedly shut out much of the group — it’s been unknown whether or not she’d show up to the reunion.</p><p>However, she’s ready to face her castmates and clear some things up.</p><p>She told Hollywood Life: ‘The only people who’ve said that I’m not going to the reunion are some of the ladies on the show and they never asked me if I was going or not. I’m planning on going if we still have [it]. I don’t know how we’re going to be doing the reunion now. Maybe things will be lifted and we’ll be able to do it, even if it’s on Zoom. But I never said that I wasn’t going to be there. They’re the ones that are saying that.’</p><p>As far as the leaks go, Denise is questioning why those like Glanville is letting the drama spill off-screen.</p><p>‘I look at things a little differently. I personally would’ve loved for everything to be played out on the show. We were filming for quite a few months together and why reveal storylines that have been in the media even before it aired?’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Are you looking forward to the far-out RHOBH reunion?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeUmruqv8RmqaKbmJa%2Fpb%2BMsKClpF2Xsm6vzqagp59dqbxuvseomaFloprCr7XOp2SanqSav26%2FyqKnqaGenHqwwdNmpqdllp65rrXNoGRscGhuhXR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
