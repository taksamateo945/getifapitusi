The team sits fourth in the division with a 50-55 record and is six games back of a wild-card spot.</p><p>Verlander told The Athletic's <a href=# rel=noopener>Will Sammon</a> on July 18 that he hadn't thought about his no-trade clause and remained "committed to trying to win a championship" with the Mets despite being included in numerous rumors.</p><p>"Just because we're not in the position that everyone—including myself—thought we would be in doesn't mean I still don't believe," Verlander said. "… I mean, I came here to win a championship. Look, nobody, including myself, is giving up on this season"</p><p>Verlander, who won his third Cy Young award in 2022, signed a two-year, <a href=# rel=noopener>$86.7 million</a> deal with the Mets as a free agent ahead of the 2023 season. The deal also includes a $35 million vesting option for 2025.</p><p>The 40-year-old is in the midst of another solid season. He's 6-5 with a 3.15 ERA, 1.15 WHIP and 81 strikeouts in 94.1 innings across 16 starts. He'll surely be an asset to the Astros as they aim to repeat as World Series champions.</p><p>Verlander was first linked to the Astros on Monday when The Athletic's <a href=# rel=noopener>Ken Rosenthal and Chandler Rome</a> reported that Houston was involved in the discussions for him.</p><p>Verlander spent five-and-a-half seasons with the Astros from 2017-2022 after coming over in a trade from the Detroit Tigers. He won two World Series with the club and won two of his three Cy Young awards in Houston.</p><p>The Astros were in desperate need of some pitching depth this summer with José Urquidy, Lance McCullers Jr. and Luis Garcia all on the 60-day injured list.</p><p>Verlander will now be the highlight of a rotation that includes Framber Valdez, Cristian Javier, Hunter Brown and J.P. France.</p><p>Houston sits second in the AL West with a 60-47 record and is threatening the Texas Rangers for the top spot in the division.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaGiCeYSMo6ysrJmjerex0aWYp5yVp3q1vsCdnJ1lpKR6or%2FTq6asZZanvK55zJ6rrGWWpL9uvNGoqqmdk6nAbrDRnq5mn5mhr6a%2B02apspmeYrCttcWfpquc</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
