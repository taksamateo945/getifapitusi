Looking through rose-tinted glasses, Payson sings about the fondness that’s found in the simplest of moments with a loved one. Driven by his soaring, powerful vocals, a sleek drum groove, and polished production, this song is the embodiment of pop music.</p><p>The track has been produced by Ben Soldate, and&nbsp; is co-written with Selda Sahin. Speaking about writing the single with Sahin, Lewis says: “We discovered that we both shared in this practice of ‘rose-tinting’ our past. We forgot the fights and unhappiness. We remembered the laughter and the adventures. Not in a longing way, just in a fond way. I identify strongly with looking back in kindness and not in anger”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking further about ‘When Love Was Young’, Payson says:&nbsp;“I wrote this song over a few glasses of wine and a lifetime of nostalgia and love gone by. I think back on all the love I’ve shared and know that every broken heart has led me to be where I am and made me who I am. For that, I’m totally thankful. I wouldn’t want to be anywhere but here. But at the same time there will always be a part of me that wonders, “what if” or “maybe someday.” I think we all do that to an extent. Love is permanent whether it’s active or not. That space in your heart where someone used to live will always be there. No matter what. And that’s what “WHEN LOVE WAS YOUNG” is all about. You know, sometimes you just think about that person, and in your head, you’re right back there with them. In the version of your story when the love didn’t end.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can listen to Payson Lewis’ debut single ‘When Love Was Young’ right here as we bring you the exclusive first listen of the track;</p><p>Make sure you follow Payson Lewis on Twitter <a href=#>@paysonlewis</a> to keep up to date with all his latest music and tour news!</p><p><strong>What do you think of Payson Lewis’ debut single ‘When Love Was Young’?
