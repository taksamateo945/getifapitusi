Since the beginning of Season 2, there has been friction between the two ladies. It reached a boiling point during the ladies’ vacation to Zion when Cosby told Nguyen they were no longer friends. Following their journey, the two met at Lisa Burlow’s party, which was seen in the finale. Cosby was spotted ignoring Nguyen, which irritated him. Whitney Rose wanted to speak with Cosby after the night. As the women sat down to talk, Nguyen stepped in and accused Cosby of being cruel.</p><p>The latter attempted to ignore her once more before taking Rose away to resume their talk. This infuriated Nguyen, who shoved Rose aside and began ranting at Cosby. The conflict erupted when Cosby started to leave without listening to Nguyen’s ranting. In a passion, she flung her glass at Cosby, prompting the Pentecostal First Lady to leave the celebration.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Jennie-Nguyen-2.jpg alt="Jennie Nguyen" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Here are some reactions from fans to Jennie Nguyen’s wrath.</h2><p>Cosby was observed leaving the party feeling relieved but sad since none of the females stood by her. She said that the individuals she believed were her friends were not, in fact, her pals. When Cosby said this, the camera was focused on Meredith Marks. Nguyen apologized to Barlow at the party for spoiling her evening. The latter embraced her and said she didn’t mind if a few glasses were shattered. Nguyen’s aggressive approach to Cosby, on the other hand, irritated fans.</p><h2>Nguyen and Cosby will not be returning to RHOSLC.</h2><p>Interestingly, Nguyen and Cosby, who had significant screen time in the finale, will not be returning for the following season. Bravo fired Nguyen for making racist statements on social media for those who were unaware, and Cosby left the franchise. The homemakers’ treatment of Cosby is alleged to be the cause for her departure from RHOSLC.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Mary-Cosby-1.jpg alt="Mary Cosby" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Meredith Marks announced her departure on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen. Heather Gay was preparing for her father’s burial, Jen Shah was dealing with a money laundering issue, and Whitney Rose attempted to spice things up with her husband in the RHOSLC finale. The reality program will include three reunion episodes. The first installment, hosted by Cohen, will run on Bravo on Sunday, February 27, at 9:00 p.m. ET.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihnqaenrJuusausJ6mXayutHnFoqmenF2Xxm6u0ZqtqGWWpL9uucCkoKefXaeupLXSrWSsrJGpsq6xza2qZqeeYsCwr8iao2allZm2ons%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
