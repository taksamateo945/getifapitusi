Madden used to come home from school crying because of bullies making fun of his appearance.</p><p>“It broke my heart,” Madden’s mother, Christina Humphreys stated. “At the end of last year, he made a book about how he had no friends and had to play by himself. It was gut-wrenching.”</p><p>Madden met Moon two weeks ago, he’s a rescue cat from Minnesota who also has a cleft lip and two different coloured eyes (called <a href=#>heterochromia</a>). Everything changed for the little boy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/maddenandmoon1.jpg><p>“They instantly bonded — it was their destiny to be best friends,” says Christina. “We were meant to have this kitty join the family.”</p><p>Christina stumbled across a photo of Moon by chance one afternoon and immediately knew he would be a good match for her son. The Humphrey’s family fundraised for the trip from Oklahoma to Minnesota, then took off on the 11-hour drive to pick up the cat.</p><p>The story is a reminder that although you may look different, you’re not alone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/maddenandmoon2.jpg><p>“I’m so thankful Madden has Moon,” Christina wrote. “Not only so that both he and the kitty have a relatable and sweet companion, but also, I hope Moon helps Madden realize that being born unique is an incredible thing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCpnaSoe6%2Bx02iiopxdmLmmstNmo6KoXZ2ytbHRqJqhqp%2BitqJ5wJ2mqayjYrCiwI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
