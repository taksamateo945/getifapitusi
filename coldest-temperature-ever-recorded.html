For example, the next time you're on the verge of cursing mother nature when you wake up to see that it's 25 degrees Fahrenheit outside, you can find solace in the fact that in 1943, the temperature in Idaho was 85 degrees colder than that! Curious to learn how low the temperature has gotten <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>in your home state</a>?

However, the coldest it's ever been was <strong>-80°</strong> on Jan. 23, 1971.

However, things aren't always as we imagine them—and they certainly weren't on both Jan. 5, 1975, and May 17, 1979, when the temperature at the Mauna Kea Observatory on the state's big island of Hawaii dropped to a record low of just <strong>12°</strong>.

The first time was on Jan. 12, 1912, in the city of Washta, and it happened again on Feb. 3, 1996, in the city of <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Elkader</a>. And be on the lookout for other 1996 record lows on this list—that was the year a severe&nbsp;nor'easter dumped up to four feet of snow on many parts of the Northeast.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/kansas-state-building-winter.jpg><p>The winter of 1905 was a chilly one for Kansas inhabitants.
