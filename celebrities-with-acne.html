She freely discussed her struggles with having unattractive skin.</p><h3></h3><h3><span id=Bekah_Martinez>Bekah Martinez</span></h3>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by bekah martinez (@bekah)</a></p><p>alum of “Bachelor” Bekah Matinez has endured significant acne problems for a very long period. The 27-year-old television personality earlier posted two images, one with red, pimple-filled skin and the other with skin that was almost clear. She discussed how she dealt with her skin problems by putting an emphasis on her gut health.</p><p>“I didn’t realize it had anything to do with my gut health until lately; I’ll be talking a lot more about it in the coming weeks. No, it’s not plexus or any other supplement; instead, you need to regularly include actual raw food in your diet, she noted. She doesn’t think clay masks or coconut oil can perform such miracles. Focus must be placed on intestinal health.</p><h3><span id=Bella_Thorne>Bella Thorne</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/gettyimages-1144942706.jpg alt width=490 height=488 sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The 25-year-old actress Bella Thorne, well known for “My Own Worst Enemy,” has been outspoken about her battle with acne. The American actress and singer tweeted, “Good morning, I’m extremely happy of my skin and how far we have gone,” beside a photo of herself without makeup in 2020. She discussed her battle with skin problems and how she overcame the passage of time.</p><p>The American beauty explained how she takes care of her skin in her “Guide to Acne-Prone Skin Care and Glitter Eyes.” Her skin is considerably clearer and healthier now.

Bella, however, attempted everything, including microneedling, lasers, and vampire facials, but nothing was successful.</p><p>One should never wash one’s face, she advises her followers. She admitted that not washing her face in the morning had truly helped her skin seem clearer. If you’re unaware, excessive scrubbing and washing might damage the skin’s protective layer and “upset the water lipid-protein balance.” Bacteria can readily enter the skin when you overwash.</p><h3><span id=Cameron_Dallas>Cameron Dallas</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/cameron-dallas-acne-struggle-xout-ambassador.jpg alt width=150 height=150 sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In his teenage years, American internet sensation Cameron Dallas, better known as “Chasing Cameron,” battled serious acne problems.
