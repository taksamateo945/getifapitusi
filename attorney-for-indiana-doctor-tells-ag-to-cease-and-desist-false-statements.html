Rokita also claimed that Bernard had a history of failing to report abortions — allegations that have been repeated by an anti-abortion group and conservative media outlets.&nbsp;</p><p>In a letter to Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb (R) on Thursday, Rokita said that his office had made multiple attempts through several agencies to obtain proof that Bernard had disclosed the abortion and had not yet obtained any records.</p><p>But even after multiple media outlets obtained public records that confirmed Bernard fully complied with all applicable reporting laws, Delaney alleged that Rokita continued to make false statements. Those statements put Bernard in danger, DeLaney wrote.</p><p>“We are especially concerned that, given the controversial political context of the statements, such inflammatory accusations have the potential to incite harassment or violence from the public, which could prevent Dr. Bernard, an Indiana licensed physician, from providing care to her patents safely,” DeLaney wrote.</p><a href=# class=thehill-promo-link__link rel=noopener><br>Energy & Environment — Manchin throws wrench into climate deal</a><br><a href=# class=thehill-promo-link__link rel=noopener><br>Health Care —&nbsp;Biden tells Senate to move on health bill</a><br><p>In a statement to The Hill, Rokita’s office indicated it had not yet received the letter.</p><p>“Like any correspondence, it will be reviewed if and when it arrives. Regardless, no false or misleading statements have been made.”</p><p>Updated at 4:53 p.m.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8eemKWsmGK7psPSaJitrJ%2Bnu6bFjJ%2Bmq2WZo7Gqrc2aZJ2nk6m8s3nTnqOlq12WtG7AzmaanpmjmnqiusNmm56rmajBbrLApaqeZaOprrWxzJ6lratf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
