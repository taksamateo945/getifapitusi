The first season of Darwin’s Game first aired in January 2020 and after 11 episodes, it ended in March of the same year. Since then, fans have been anticipating the release of the second season which although has not been announced, many are hoping an announcement would come before the end of 2024.</strong></p><p>The anime series first began as FLIPFLOPs’ manga series, which was released in 28 volumes from 2012 to 2023 when the latest volume was released. The adaptation into anime was announced in 2018 by the Nexus studio and in 2020 it dropped. While fans of the series still await words from Nexus and FLIPFLOPs, here is all that we know.</p><h2><strong>Will There Be a Season 2 of Darwin’s Game?</strong></h2><p>As it stands, there has been no word from Nexus on when the series will start its second season, but we are almost certain that there will be a sequel to the first season. The reason for this is that the first season has been very successful both in Japan where it originated and also in other parts of the world, including the United States.</p><p>While one may believe that Nexus would ride on the success of the first season and drop another, there has still been no renewal for the series, even though it has also not been canceled. Another reason why we are expecting the release of a second season is that there are still many chapters in the illustrated work that are yet to be covered by the series.</p><p>The first season ended in Chapter 36 in the volume of the illustrated work and so the second season will continue from the 37th chapter. There are more than a hundred chapters in Darwin’s Game Manga, which means there will be a need for more seasons to continue where the first season ended.</p><h2><strong>When is Darwin’s Game Season 2 Release Date on Netflix</strong></h2><p>A release date for Darwin’s Game Season 2 has not yet been announced, hence, it is uncertain when<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal> it will be on Netflix</a>. However, fans believe that it may most likely come towards the end of 2024, but that this is only based on speculation and not an official confirmation.</p><p>The reason why it is unlikely that the show will come any earlier than the end of 2024 is because <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Nexus announced</a> that it was going to release the second season of The Eminence in Shadow in October 2023, which means that 2023 is out of its calendar.</p><h2><strong>Is Darwin’s Game Manga Finished?</strong></h2><p>With the release of the 28th volume of the iconic manga in 2023 which has sold more than 8.5 million copies, it is believed that it might have either ended or is very close to ending. However, it is not expected to continue beyond 2023.</p><p>In January 2020, it was made known that it entered its final arc, and then by January 2022, it was said to have climaxed, setting the scene for it to end.</p><h2><strong>Darwin’s Game Season 2 Characters</strong></h2><p>When the sequel of the animated series returns, a majority of the main characters will be back and it is believed that they will also be voiced by their respective voice actors as in the first season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/byliner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Darwins-Game-Season-e1691134645162.jpg><h3><strong>Some of the Darwin’s Game Characters will include the following:</strong></h3><ul><li>Kaname Sudo (Yūsuke Kobayashi)</li><li>Shuka Karino (Reina Ueda)</li><li>Rein Kashiwagi (Nichika Omori)</li><li>Ryuji Maesaka (Taku Yashiro)</li><li>Sui/Sota (Yumiri Hanamori)</li><li>Liu Xuelan (Ai Kayano)</li></ul><h2><strong>Darwin’s Game Season 2 Episodes</strong></h2><p>The number of episodes that may most likely accompany Darwin’s Game Season 2 is not certain just as most other things about the anticipated release of the anime. That said, there are 11 episodes in the first season of the anime and also another episode that recaps the first 4 episodes.</p><h2><strong>Where To Watch Darwin’s Game</strong></h2><p>There are various streaming platforms where you can watch the first season of Darwin’s Game. These include Netflix, Hulu, Crunchyroll, and Funimation Now. You can also access it on Amazon Basic, but that is if you are willing to deal with all the ads that accompany the subscription. You can also easily get the anime series from Amazon Video or Microsoft Store.</p><p>If the second season of the anticipated series comes, it will also be expected to be available on these and various other streaming services.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaqaG2r7HRZ5qopV%2BZrrPDyKeqZp%2BRorJuv8SaqqimXWd6s7HLnpisnV2ZrrWxjJyfmqqRmMGmvtJmmKecXaW5sMCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
