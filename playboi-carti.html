In a 2016 interview with Complex he stated, “My ma couldn’t tell me shit. Nobody could tell me shit.” This type of lifestyle influenced Carter to get into trouble as a youth and sway away from the idea of pursuing a higher level of education after high school. He attended North Springs Charter High School in Sandy Springs. Before rap Carter wanted to become an NBA star to try and make something of himself. In an interview with The Fader Carti said “I was a young AI and didn’t go to practice. That was the time I was really ducking school and it was all hoop and no rap. I would smoke before practice, get on the court and drop 30.” Growing up playing basketball Carti looked up to players like Michael Jordan, Allen Iverson, Tracy McGrady, and Vince Carter. After not showing up to practice and getting into a disagreement with his coach Carter stopped pursuing basketball as a career option and started spending more time on music. Carter skipped high school classes regularly to work on his music or go to his job at H&M which led to Carti barely graduating high school. In an interview with The Fader he said, “I was in class with freshmen finishing work, and if I finished the nine assignments before this time I could graduate.” He was so close to not graduating that that no one showed up to his graduation because they didn’t know he was going to graduate. Carti hated the idea of being an upcoming rapper working at H&M, so he made the decision to quit.</p><p align=justify>In 2018, Carter began dating Australian rapper Iggy Azalea.</p><h2>Who is Playboi Carti Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Playboi Carti</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
