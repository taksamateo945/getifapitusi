It was all part of the show!"</p><p>During Game 4 of the NBA Finals on Friday, McGregor participated in what was supposed to be a fun skit with Burnie the mascot to promote his new Tidl pain relief spray. Unfortunately, the boxing match ended quickly with the mascot receiving one of the former two-division champion's patented left hooks, followed by another when he hit the ground.</p>SportsCenter <span class=acct>@SportsCenter</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Conor McGregor KO'd the Heat mascot ðŸ˜… &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NBAFinals?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NBAFinals&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/IRAKzuMKp2">pic.twitter.com/IRAKzuMKp2&lt;/a></p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Sam Amick</a> of The Athletic, the man that plays the mascot was <a href=#>taken</a> to the emergency room at a nearby hospital for treatment.

Miami put up more of a fight in Game 5, but Denver earned a 94-89 win to claim its first NBA championship in franchise history.</p><p>As for McGregor, he has yet to return to the Octagon since suffering a broken tibia in his second straight loss to Dustin Poirier in July 2021. He's currently coaching on the 31st season of <i>The Ultimate Fighter</i> reality series opposite Michael Chandler, who he's expected to meet in his return fight later this year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZ25%2FcYCMnKanp6JiuqSz0Z6eqKpdqK66v4yhnJqsXaKutK%2FOrWSiq12cvLCwjJqdrZ2iYrWwv8%2Biq5qkXam%2FqryMn6mopV2jr6J5xaKlmqSjYsCstdM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
