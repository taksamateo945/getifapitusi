He Loves Her, Brother Val Chmerkovskiy Says</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>Sounds like a love for the ages! <strong><a href=#>Maksim Chmerkovskiy</a></strong> and <strong>Meryl Davis</strong>' Dancing With the Stars win on Tuesday, May 20, was a huge moment on the show, but for people who've been watching their relationship evolve throughout the competition, the Mirrorball Trophy was just the shiny icing on the cake. Fans—including judge <strong>Carrie Ann Inaba</strong>—are convinced the two should get married. However, Maks' brother <strong>Val Chmerkovskiy</strong> says their love is beyond the romantic.</p><p>"She was good for him, but I feel it wouldn't do their love justice," the DWTS pro, 28, told <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> at <a href=#>the season 18 finale</a> on Tuesday. "One makeout session in the middle of the dance or to label it that they are a couple—it sounds great, but that's not what it is. He loves her probably more than I've seen him love another woman—he loves and adores her—but it's like a King Kong type of relationship."</p><p>Elaborating on that, he continued: "She's precious, and he's gentle with her because he wants to see her shine and he won't want to hurt her. He's willing to calm down for her because she's the last person he wants to see cry and the last person he wants to hurt."</p><p>That kind of love, Val said, is "bigger than a kiss" or a hookup—even though Maks, 34, joked on Tuesday's finale that he wanted to "ravish" his partner and have "big, ice-dancing" babies with her.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"He definitely loves her, and I know she loves him back," Val told <strong>Us</strong> of his brother, whose victory with Davis, 27, was his first in 14 seasons of competition. ("There's a reason it didn't happen before," Maks said on the finale. "It's because I was meant to do it with her.")</p><p>Val added, too, that the whole Chmerkovskiy family has fallen in love with Davis as a person. "We as a family love her, too. We love Meryl, but I don't know if they were meant for each other or just meant to be in each other's lives for this moment," he explained. "Or for many moments, definitely, as it's a friendship they'll keep for a very long time."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOppikq12Wu6V5zJ6psqRdma61tc2gZKGdXaG8t7HSZp%2Beql2Xv7DAx56pZq6RoXqktMyeqaSnpqi4qsWMrJiyq11nfXKAkWps</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
