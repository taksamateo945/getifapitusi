Just a few weeks ago<a href=# rel=noopener>, Chris came forward with his first YouTube video</a> in months in which he admitted to being overly concerned with sex over the course of his career. In fact, the stand-up comedian says it dominated and controlled his life.</p><p>Fans will recall when social media users accused Chris of messaging them when they were too young, including one girl who just filed a lawsuit against the LA comic this week. Chris remained silent for approximately one year when the first claims came out.</p><p>As for the new lawsuit, it concerns accusations of sexual exploitation from a former 17-year-old who goes by the name of Jane Doe to protect her identity, Page Six revealed. According to Jane Doe in the court documents, she and Chris connected on social media when she was just 17 in 2014. She says Chris obviously knew how old she was because <a href=# rel=noopener>he had liked some of her photos</a> that clearly showed her age.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CL9mDzCsZcv/</p><p>The accuser claims the then-34-year-old comedian invited her and one of her friends out to his show in Connecticut. However, she says he asked her to come up to his hotel room before the performance, which she declined to do, initially. She says she was told to leave her friend behind, which she wound up doing.</p><p>She says D’Elia grabbed her hand and made her pleasure him with it. After repeatedly telling him that she was only 17 and still in high school, as a form of saying “no,” she says they had sex anyway.</p><p>Chris and his attorney denied the allegations in a statement to the Los Angeles Times, Page Six explained. The girl says she and <a href=# rel=noopener>Chris D’Elia</a> began to send each other over 100 messages and videos over the course of 6-7 months.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>They finally stopped speaking to each other in May 2015. As it was noted above, <a href=# title="Chris D’Elia Responds To His Accusers – ‘It Is Important That The Public Has All The Information’"><strong>Chris D’Elia</strong></a> released his first Youtube video in months via his account back in February. The comedian went on to say how he knew how it “looked,” adding that the allegations never revealed the “full scope” of what really happened.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeTnb%2Bqv4ydnKWhkWKupK%2FUrJydZZ%2BberS7y6KaoqyZo7Ruv8SxrJqkXaW1sMDOrGSfqp%2BieqJ5zKKlqKpdnrtuusSwZKWZp6jCqsCMmmSfp6KisrN5kHBksp2Rp3qwuMNmnqKqnGKzs7vMZpqopp6asLW1wq6rZmxnboBygo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
