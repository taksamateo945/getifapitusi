Sandoval is looking to make a comeback after being out of the league for a few years.</p><p>"Sandoval has been telling friends that he feels great and is trying to make a comeback at the age of 37," Pavlovic wrote.</p><p>Sandoval hasn't played in the major leagues since 2021 when he played 69 games for the Atlanta Braves, hitting .178 and notching 13 hits and four home runs.</p><p>Since his major league exit in 2021, Sandoval has played for two different organizations in Mexico and he spent part of last fall playing in a league in Dubai. It's not clear whether Sandoval still has what it takes to contribute to the Giants, but he has at least stayed in baseball shape while away from the majors.</p><p>Sandoval had two stints in San Francisco—the first coming from 2008 to 2014 and the second coming from 2017 to 2020. He helped San Francisco win three World Series in his first stint, taking home the championship in 2010, 2012 and 2014.</p><p>In his 16-year MLB career, Sandoval had a .278 career average with 1,279 hits, 639 RBI and 153 home runs.</p><p>Sandoval's Giants comeback might be a stretch despite his history with the club. San Francisco seems set at third base and with a lack of lefties at first base—where Sandoval played in 2020—the Giants will likely be looking to add a left-handed first baseman rather than another righty.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYG6EeX%2BMqZibpJ9iwKK6w6itmqRdnLaiutOsZJqfopqybsDOZqSipJJisLC606uYnKxdm7yzedKpqaKml2LBs63Ip6Cnn12WuqqwjKajm2WimsG2vs1mmaKc</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
