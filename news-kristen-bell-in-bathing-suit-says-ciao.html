The 41-year-old lounged in the sun wearing a black swimsuit paired with a super cute Clare V. baseball cap emblazoned with the word CIAO in bold letters. So, it only made sense for her to caption the post with the Italian word for hello, as well: "Ciao." How does the Good Place actress made 41 look like 21?

However, in late 2017 she added some animal products, like humanely raised dairy and eggs, back into her diet. "I think being vegan is a wonderful way to live and it has great effects on the body," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Today</span></a><span>. "I also think it has really good effects on the environment." What does she eat? She revealed to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Shape</span></a><span> that she starts with an egg white, spinach and feta scramble with hot sauce for breakfast, followed by a salad with fruit and veggies for lunch, usually with produce from her garden, unch is usually a salad with any fruit and veggies she can find, including those she grows right in her garden, she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Shape</span></a><span>. She sources protein creatively, for example by eating chickpea pasta.&nbsp;</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/GettyImages-1207796039.jpg><p><span>Bell is all about getting her zen on. "Meditation makes me feel more rested than a full night's sleep," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Live Happy magazine</span></a><span>. "I do transcendental meditation a couple times a week and have a mantra that I repeat in a still, calm position. I really enjoy powering down for 20 minutes because it's like shutting off light switches in my brain. I should make more time for it, but meditating even a couple times a week makes a big difference in my stress and happiness levels."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"Most days, I run or lift weights for at least 30 minutes," Bell has revealed about her workout routine. "Or I'll take a CrossFit class on indoorphins.com." She also likes pilates and SoulCycle.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/GettyImages-1199533561.jpg><p><span>Bell is also a fan of microworkouts. "I find if I can make tiny bargains with myself, I can incrementally move forward. Like I will say, 'Today all you have to do is jog for seven minutes.' 'Today all you have to do is jog for 10 minutes.' And I rarely go past 15 or 20, if ever," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Women's Health</span></a><span>. "If you give yourself realistic, attainable goals, you can totally achieve them—and that sense of triumph will make your workout feel even better." She also makes sure to add movement no matter what she is doing: "Just getting moving in any way, whether it's taking a walk with them or running around on their bikes in the driveway with them. So then my body just doesn't feel stagnant," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Self</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/GettyImages-1192156680.jpg><p><span>Bell is a big proponent of working out for mental health. "Exercise should be the first stop for anyone who experiences depression or anxiety because it encourages serotonin and endorphins," she explained to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Women's Health.</span></a><span> "I feel so much more centred, patient, capable. It sets the next 48 hours for me."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/GettyImages-1187403575.jpg><p><span>Bell, whose husband, Dax Shepard, is sober, rarely drinks. "I maybe have one drink a year solely because I think I might be allergic to alcohol," Kristen told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Women's Health.</span></a><span>&nbsp; "When I do have a drink, I experience the flu the next day. This isn't normal. No one should have this much of a hangover over a glass of wine."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/GettyImages-1202252514.jpg><p><span>In 2019, Bell "woke up" with celiac, she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Women's Health</span></a><span>. "I don't know what … is going on." She went on to explain that she found out she had the genetic marker for celiac disease. "Who knows what that means yet but I am experimenting with being completely gluten-free, which is very annoying to do, but I think it is going to help my eczema."</span></p><p><span>"I'm not super restrictive," Bell told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Women's Health</span></a><span> about her diet. "If they make au gratin potatoes, I'm going to have some, but I am mindful of the portion I take. I find that through conscious eating, I'm able to have all the rewards and also maintain a healthy, steady diet."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkpKqZqMGmuoybnKWkXZ67bq7ArZ%2BippdiwLa102aqmrGjYrCqrc5o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
