Continue reading for our review.</p><p>Derek Hough (“Dancing with the Stars,” “World of Dance”), dancer, singer, judge, and choreographer, embarked on his first ever 56-city solo tour. In the past, he has toured with his sister, Julianne Hough (“Dancing with the Stars,” “America’s Got Talent”), and with “Dancing with the Stars” but this is his first ever solo tour.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/derek-hough-live-the-tour-review-03-1024x768.jpg alt width=662 height=497 sizes="(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The show opened with an explosive number filled with live instruments, streamers, and many dancers on stage.</p><p>After the opening number, Hough greeted the fans. It was the second to the last show of the tour, so he wanted it to be a special one.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/derek-hough-live-the-tour-review-04-1024x768.jpg alt width=662 height=497 sizes="(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Filled with dancing, singing, guitar playing, and motivational talks, Hough proved why he earned himself a solo tour.</p><p>To keep the fans in tune with the show, he ran, danced, and sang down the aisle of the theater, even pulling some fans on stage to leap over their heads. The female dancers pulled two men on stage to dance with them also.</p><p>The show was filled with many different genres of dance, from contemporary, to tap, to ballroom, to Latin. They did it all to many different songs.</p><p>Here are some of our favorite performances:</p><p>The “Singin’ in the Rain” Medley, where Hough sang and dance to the title track and ‘Moses Supposes,’ was the highlight of the show. He showcased all of his talents in that number.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/derek-hough-live-the-tour-review-02-1024x768.jpg alt width=662 height=497 sizes="(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Along with singing that number, Hough belted out Bruce Springsteen’s ‘Born to Run’ and ‘In My Blood’ by Shawn Mendes.</p><p>After singing “In My Blood,” Hough sat down with the fans and talked about the importance of mental health and that YOU ARE ENOUGH, no matter what you accomplish or do. He proceeded to sing a medley of hits from “A Star is Born” while his dancers performed around him. It was very powerful and relatable to the audience.</p><p>Hough went back to his Ballroom roots in the number ‘Malaguena.’ The Paso Doble is his favorite to perform and you could tell from that performance.</p><p>He ended the show by dancing to a medley of “The Greatest Showman” songs, which was the best way to end it, inspiring him and his fans to follow their dreams.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/derek-hough-live-the-tour-review-05-1024x768.jpg alt width=662 height=497 sizes="(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>He shines on the stage, and no not just from his sweat, but from his passion and love for performing.</p><p>Despite this being Hough’s solo tour, he brought along many dancers with him. It did not feel like one overshadowed the other and each dancer had their own turn at the spotlight. If you ever get the chance to see him live, please go.</p><p>We hope this was only the first of many solo tours!</p><p>Rating: 5 out of 5 stars</p><h4>Did you attend a show?
