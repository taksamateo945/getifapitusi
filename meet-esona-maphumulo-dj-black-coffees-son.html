Nevertheless, the period was one of the happiest moments of his life. The birth of his son motivated him and gave him a reason to chase all his dreams. Nkosinathi Maphumulo also revealed that his son‚Äôs mother named him Esona Sinokuhle.</p><p>Furthermore, between 2011 and 2019, Sona had a stepmother in the person of <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Enhle Mbali</a> whom his father married in 2011 and they later <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>divorced</a> in 2019. His ex-stepmother is an actress, TV presenter, and fashion designer well-known for scoring the role of Lindi Mabaso in Rockville. After his father‚Äôs divorce, it was alleged that Esona Maphumulo didn‚Äôt get along with his stepmom.</p><h2 dir=auto><strong>Meet Esona Maphumulo‚Äôs Siblings</strong></h2><p>Although DJ Black Coffee is known to be a father of four children, he is said to have welcomed other children outside wedlock whilst married to Mbali.

Though many people were impressed with his performance, a few others took to social media to <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">criticize</a> him for using one hand to perform when he is only at the early stages of his career and should be using both hands.</p><p>Sona, not finding the comments funny, quickly defended himself in a Twitter post.

Hence, he struggled to make a beat for the song and eventually, his son helped him to produce a beat for it. ‚ÄòTexts Go Green‚Äô did quite well on many music charts and Esona was proud of his achievement which he shared with his followers on Twitter.
