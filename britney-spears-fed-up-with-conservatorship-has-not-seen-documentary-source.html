She knows it’s a battle&nbsp;for her whole life.”</p><p>In November, Britney’s attorney, Samuel D. Ingham III, claimed in a court hearing that the “Toxic” singer&nbsp;<a href=#>had become “afraid”</a>&nbsp;of her father, Jamie Spears, and wanted him removed from her conservatorship. “She will not perform again if her father is in charge of her career,” he said.</p><p>Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny declined to suspend Jamie, 68, from his duties, but stated that she was open to hear arguments for his removal in the future. Bessemer Trust was named as co-conservator.</p><p>Jamie told CNN in December that he <a href=#>hadn’t spoken to his daughter</a> in months.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">Jamie and Britney Spears<span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>“When a family member needs special care and protection, families need to step up, as I have done for the last 12-plus years, to safeguard, protect and continue to love Britney unconditionally,” he said. “I have and will continue to provide unwavering love and fierce protection against those with self-serving interests and those who seek to harm her or my family.”</p><p>Britney has been&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">under conservatorship</a>&nbsp;since her infamous mental breakdown in 2007.</p><p>“Framing Britney Spears,” which was released Friday on FX and Hulu, showed the “Baby One More Time” singer’s rise to fame, mental health issues as a result of severe public scrutiny, conservatorship and the #FreeBritney movement.</p><p>Over the weekend, celebrities came out in droves to <a href=#>show their support</a>, calling the pop star’s situation “sad” and “heartbreaking.”</p><p>But despite the latest microscopic attention on her ongoing legal issues due to the documentary, a source told Page Six on Monday that Britney is “happy and lively.”</p><p>The next court date over the battle for conservatorship is on Feb. 11.</p><p>A rep for Britney did not immediately return our request for comment.</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnkqe2tbrEsmSsqJWWv7R5xZ6bZq2gYsSqwMdmmqimo5q%2Ft63TqKmsoJmleqmt0malqKxdqLKmuoydppytnZq7ta3RsmSsp6WnsKZ7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
